			<h4>SOFTWARE PROJECTS</h4>
			<p>
				<b>Barter App:</b> <br>
				I, and a small team of other students, using Google's Firebase, Maps, and Cloud APIs,
				created an app for the currency-free trading of items. (similar to facebook marketplace
				but for trading)
			</p>
			<p>
				The app allowed users to log in as either a "Provider" or a "Receiver," offering different
				utilities to each role: posting products and viewing incoming offers for "Providers," searching for products,
				viewing sent offers, and setting notification preferences for "Receivers."
			</p>

				<p>Screenshots of the receiver and provider dashboards.</p>
			</div>

			<p>
				Users could change their role at any time in their settings, allowing one to seemlessly switch between the app's
				two modes when desired.
			</p>

			<p>
				Receivers could search either with filters, or by viewing a map of items in their area.

			</div>

			<p>
				With similar forms, the providers were able to post products, view their listings, and view incoming offers.
				Recievers were able to set preferences allowing for them to be notified when new items were listed matching their criteria.

			<h4>IT AND SYS-INTEGRATION</h4>
			<p>
				<b>Linux and Windows Systems:<b> <br>
				I have experience working with bash and Powershell CLI tools. I have some experience with Windows
				Group Policy and Active Directory management. I've been using Linux for years now and am familiar
				and comfortable with terminal workflows, systemd, and tools like OSSH and git.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>System Integration:<b> <br>
				I've been building computers as a hobby for over a decade now and was installing Windows XP for fun before that.
				I built my first computer in 2014. I love working with hardware and have built systems for friends and private
				clients as well as for myself.
