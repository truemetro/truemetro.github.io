			<h3>Barter Trader App</h3>

			<p>
				The app allowed users to log in as either a "Provider" or a "Receiver," offering different
				utilities to each role: posting products and viewing incoming offers for "Providers," searching for products,
				viewing sent offers, and setting notification preferences for "Receivers."

				<p>Screenshots of the receiver and provider dashboards.</p>
			</div>

			<p>
				Users could change their role at any time in their settings, allowing one to seemlessly switch between the app's
				two modes when desired.

			<p>
				Receivers could search either with filters, or by viewing a map of items in their area.

			<p>
				With similar forms, the providers were able to post products, view their listings, and view incoming offers.
				Recievers were able to set preferences allowing for them to be notified when new items were listed matching
				their
				criteria.
